## 🧠 Overview  

**Rain World** is an atmospheric survival platformer set in a vast, hostile world governed by its own natural laws. Players control a small creature navigating a dangerous ecosystem where predators hunt, weather reshapes the landscape, and survival depends on awareness rather than force.

The game focuses on fluid movement, exploration, and learning from failure. Every creature behaves independently, reacting dynamically to both the player and the environment. Periodic torrential rains force strategic decisions, turning time management into a core mechanic.

With minimal guidance and subtle storytelling, Rain World invites players to interpret the world on their own terms, creating a deeply personal and memorable experience.
